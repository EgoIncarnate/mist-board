#summary Planned features of the Atari ST core

= Already implemented =

  * 8Mhz CPU (faster core slowed down by memory interface)
  * Up to 14MB fully DMA supported and video capable ST RAM
  * ROM cartridge support
  * Support for 256k and 192k ROM images
  * TOS versions 1.00, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06, 1,62 2.06 and EmuTOS 0.8.7, 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 and probably more ...
  * All three ST video modes
  * Scan doubler for color modes for VGA compatibility
  * PAL 56 HZ for VGA compatibility
  * Floppy disk emulation via SD card (.ST formats incl. HD (1.44MB) and ED (2.88MB)) 
  * AHDI compatible ACSI/HDD emulation via SD card using Hatari compatible ACSI images
  * MFP (Timers, RS232 redirection, IRQs, ...)
  * Sound
  * IKBD emulation (joysticks, mouse, keyboard)
  * USB mice and keyboards
  * Minimig on screen display (OSD)
  * Ability to change the core (to e.g. boot into Minimig)
  * MIDI add-on board
  * Blitter (Optional for ST, mandatory for STE)
  * STE video (4 bit per color, hard scrolling, split screen, ...)
  * STE DMA sound

= Planned/Possible =

  * Faster CPU (by using already existing fast ram interface, perhaps cache)
  * Extended video modes (e.g. 1280x960 monochrome, 640x480 16 colors)
  * Support for STX (copy protoected) floppy disk images
  * USB joysticks and gamepads

= Frequently asked things that will most likely never happen =
  
  * Falcon compatibility (This requires a DSP and various other complex things that don't fit into the MIST FPGA)
  * 68040/68060 add-on board (the MIST doesn't have enough spare IO pins for this)
  * 68040/68060 FPGA implementation (the MIST FPGA is too small for this)

= Summary =

An STE or Mega STE is likely possible, everything else like TT or even Falcon is unlikely.
