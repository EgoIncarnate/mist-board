#summary Getting started

= What you need =

The MIST board was designed for simplicity. 

Mandatory:

  * The MIST board
  * A USB keyboard
  * A micro USB phone charger for power supply (a micro USB cable connected to a USB hub or PC also works)
  * An SD card (1GB recommended)
  * A VGA screen

Optional:

  * A USB mouse
  * A classic Atari style joystick 
  * A set of PC speakers

= Preparations =

First you have to prepare the SD card. Place the following files in the root directory of a standard FAT formatted SD card:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/trunk/bin/cores/mist/core.rbf The Atari ST FPGA core (core.rbf)]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/trunk/bin/cores/mist/tos.img A (Emu-)TOS rom image (tos.img)]

= Setup =

Insert the SD card into the MIST. Connect VGA screen and USB keyboard. Finally connect the phone charger.

= Go! =

Switch the board on. It should boot into the Atari ST desktop.

= Troubleshooting =
