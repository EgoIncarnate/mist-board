= Already implemented =

  * 8Mhz CPU (faster core slowed down by memory interface)
  * Up to 14MB DMA and video capable ST RAM
  * ROM cartridge support
  * Support for 256k and 192k ROM images

  * AHDI compatible ACSI/HDD emulation via SD card. Hatari compatible images
  * MFP (Timers, RS232 redirection, IRQs, ...)
  * Sound
  * IKBD emulation (joysticks, mouse, keyboard)
  * USB mice and keyboards

= Planned/Possible =
  * Faster CPU (by using already existing fast ram interface, perhaps cache)
  * Extended video modes (e.g. 1280x960 monochrome, 640x480 16 colors)
  * MIDI add-on board
  * Support for STX (copy protoected) floppy disk images
